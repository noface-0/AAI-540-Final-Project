    "## Notebook Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook serves as a detailed documentation and workspace for our research and development process in creating a Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) reinforcement learning model tailored for stock trading. The notebook is structured to guide through the various stages of model development, from data handling to final evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notebook Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dataset Handling and Preparation**: To detail the process of acquiring, cleaning, and preparing the stock price data for model training.\n",
    "2. **Feature Engineering**: To explore and define the set of features that will be used by the SAC model, enhancing its ability to make informed trading decisions.\n",
    "3. **Model Development**: To document the iterative process of designing, training, and tuning the SAC model.\n",
    "4. **Evaluation and Testing**: To assess the model's performance using historical data, focusing on its ability to make profitable trading decisions.\n",
